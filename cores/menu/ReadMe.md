## It's a simple startup core to display menu.

Put [this core](https://github.com/sorgelig/Menu_MIST/tree/master/release) to the root of SD card with name **core.rbf**. It will be loaded automatically upon MIST startup and menu will be displayed.

From **menu** and **firmware** **220220**, the menu core has its own settings menu, where you can switch PAL/NTSC mode and rotate it for Arcade use.
