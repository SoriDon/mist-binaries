# EP994A - TI99/4A clone

## Cart loading

Cartridges can have .g (GROM), .c and .d parts. They could be auto-detected from the file extension,
or you must choose the appropriate menu item to load the correct type, if the extension is .bin.

If there's a .d part, load it last!

## Disk support
The PHP1240 disk controller card is implemented in the core, which has
a WD1771 FM-only FDC (single density).

The supported image format is v9t9 (sector dump). These images usually have
the .DSK extension.

Only single-density images are supported at the moment
(40 tracks/side, 9 sector/track), either single-sided or double-sided.

Basic usage of the disk system from BASIC:
- SAVE DSK1.PRG - saves the current BASIC program to Drive 1 as PRG
- OLD DSK1.PRG - loads the program from Drive 1
